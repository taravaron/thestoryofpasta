But it’s hopeless  – after just a few unpleasant mouthfuls, he can resist no longer.</p>

							<p><span>Yet,</span> in spite of all the myriad of forms it has taken and the countless contexts in which it has appeared, today it is almost universally associated with Italy – though historically, this has not always been the case. In fact, it is only in the last century or so that many regions of northern Italy – including Veneto, Lombardy, Liguria and the Piemonte – have embraced pasta as an essential part of their cuisine. But, there are many aspects of pasta’s history that are surprising. The early history of pasta does not begin with Italy, but rather in the Shang dynasty in China (1700-1100 BC) where some form of noodles are known to have existed – made with either wheat or rice flour. Pasta also appears to have been a feature in the diet of ancient Greek civilization, flourishing in the first millennium BC.</p>

				<p><span>But,</span> as early as the fourth century BC, the story of pasta shifts to Italy: there is archeological evidence for the existence of pasta in the Etruscan civilization, which flourished in the regions we now call Lazio, Umbria and Tuscany. A bas-relief unearthed in an Etruscan tomb depicts tools and kitchen utensils used to roll and form pasta very similar to those still in use today. A lucky find for anthropology, but a sad blow to the legend of Marco Polo, which claims it was he who introduced Europe to pasta after his adventures in the Far East. He may have brought some unusual noodles back with him, but it was certainly not the first time Italians had ever seen such food.</p>

						<p><span>By the 14th century,</span> pasta was a regular part of life in Rome and Florence. As far as we know the first scholar to write extensively about pasta was the humanist known as Platina. In 1474, he wrote an important treatise, entitled “On Right Pleasure and Good Health” (De honesta volupatate et valetudine). In addition to essays on gastronomy and recipes, the treatise includes discussions on the elemental nature of food, recommended exercises for the body, and general suggestions on how to feel in harmony in life.</p>

Though Italians cannot claim to have invented pasta, it’s clear they took to the creation with an unparalleled joy, passion and inventiveness – developing an entire culture and cuisine around it, which is now recognized worldwide.</p>

				<p><span>Pure and simple:</span>
				wheat and water is what pasta is made of….durum wheat, to be more precise. Durum wheat, deriving from the Latin term tricutum durum (“durum” means “hard” in Latin), is grown in many regions of the world, including the Mediterranean countries, North America, the former Soviet Union and Argentina.
				In Italy, it grows mainly in the southern regions – most notably, in Puglia, which is known for producing some of the finest pasta in the world.</p>
				<img class="chef" src="gif/chef-gif.gif">
			</div>
			<div class="col4">
				<p>One of the most important qualities of durum wheat is that it contains more proteins than common wheat. These proteins, especially gluten, are essential for producing high-quality pasta – that is, a pasta that will remain firm, or “al dente,” when cooked. The grinding of durum wheat grains produces a coarse flour called semolina, which is the only flour used in all Italian-made pasta. Any other kind of flour – that is, the common wheat flour that is used in many breads, desserts and other preparations – results in a pasta that becomes mushy when cooked and has much less nutritional value. In 1967, a law was passed in Italy requiring that only durum wheat be used in the making of all its dried, store-bought pasta. This guarantees a certain level of quality and nutrition for any industrially produced pasta made in Italy.</p>

 					<p><span>In the last 30 years,</span> the technology in the production of pasta has grown along with the demand. If you look inside the factory of one of the many large producers of pasta in Italy – which is first in the world for quality and production – you might be surprised by the extraordinarily high-tech modernity of the process: huge, very long, spotless and nearly antiseptic spaces; enormous machinery and pasta driers; and an incredibly small number of workers compared with the thousands and thousands of kilos of pasta produced daily.
					The choice of top quality wheat, pure and balanced</p>

					<p>water, together with cutting-edge technology – including fully computerized systems monitoring every single step of the production – guarantee hygiene and the top-notch quality of the pasta produced. Rigorous Italian and international standard certifications are required by all major pasta companies. The result is that pasta today tastes and feels better then ever. There are also different kinds of pasta produced in Italy now, like whole wheat, multi-cereals and organic pasta that are in high demand from foreign markets. Italians are a bit conservative on this but very open to the fact that if Americans want to have whole wheat, there must be a reason. Pasta makers are very aware that what is in demand in the US today will most likely, in time, be demanded in Europe as well.</p>

					<p><span>An important distinction in industrially</span> produced pasta is made between bronze cut and Teflon cut – which refers to the molds, or “dies” as they are called, used in production. When Teflon dies are used, the resulting pasta is smooth and shiny. In contrast, bronze-cut pasta is rougher and more porous, producing a more homemade quality. Bronze-cut pasta holds sauces and seasonings in a way that Teflon cuts cannot.</p>

				<div class="col4">
					<p>With over 500 different denominations for pasta in Italy, the myriad of shapes that pasta now comes in can seem overwhelming. But, basically they can be broken down into just three simple categories: long cuts, short cuts and soup cuts. Long cuts – such as spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine, etc. – go well with full-bodied, olive-oil based and/or robust sauces. Short cuts – such as, penne, rigatoni, etc. – are best suited for ragù and chunky vegetable sauces.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col4">
				<p>Soup cuts – such as ditalini or acini di pepe – are particularly small so that they can be easily scooped up with a soup spoon. But Italians are not strict on what shape of pasta should be paired with which particular sauce – though “rigatoni al pesto” would very likely create some awkward silences. Experience and tradition are certainly highly valued in Italian kitchens, but fortunately the Italians’ attachment to custom is tempered by their playful and tolerant spirit.</p>

						<p><span>Only a few basic notions</span> are necessary to cook pasta well and to prepare simple, tasty dishes – in addition to a bit of experience and imagination, that is. But, first and foremost, the quality of the pasta is of utmost importance – using Italian-made imported pasta is really essential to ensure a delicious pasta dish. Boil it in a large pot with plenty of salted water, adding the salt just before adding the pasta. Remove the pasta from the heat and drain it at just the right moment – which is the moment just before you think you should. This method really works for ensuring your pasta is al dente. Sound tricky? With experience, you’ll soon get the feel for it.</p>

					<p>For many pasta preparations, you should not drain the pasta entirely – instead, after very briefly tossing it in a sieve or colander, immediately transfer it to the skillet in which you have cooked the sauce. Then, ever-so-briefly gently toss the pasta and sauce together in the skillet on a medium/low flame, until the sauce and the pasta reach the right balance – taking care not to overcook.</p>
